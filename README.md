Android EmojiCompat Sample (Kotlin)
===================================

This demo demonstrates usage of EmojiCompat support library. You can  
use this library to prevent your app from showing missing emoji  
characters in the form of tofu (â–¡). This demo
replies on the AppCompat library to manage EmojiCompat initialization.

Based upon the EmojiCompat sample in Google's [user-interface-samples](https://github.com/android/user-interface-samples) 
but migrated to [Emoji2](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/emoji2).

An additional View has been added that manages it own StaticLayout for
use with `Layout.draw(Canvas)`.
